<h1>The Best Movies According to Tshaps</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>
  Gladiator is very much about love at its core, even though it’s wrapped in
  themes of revenge and power. Love drives the actions of many characters and
  gives the story its emotional depth.
</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
  The Shawshank Redemption (1994) is a profound story about patience,
  resilience, and the enduring hope that drives a person forward even in the
  darkest of circumstances. The theme of patience is woven throughout the film
  as we follow the journey of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) over two decades in
  Shawshank Prison.
</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>
  The Matrix, is fundamentally a story about the power of the mind and
  the ability to reshape reality through belief, perception, and self-awareness.
  It delves deeply into themes of human potential, free will, and the mind’s
  role in defining what is real.
